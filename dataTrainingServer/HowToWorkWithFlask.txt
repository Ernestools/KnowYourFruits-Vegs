First steps with flask: a beginner friendly guide
written by a beginner(nay) for a friendly little cutie(rimo)  

the official documentation said to run these commands:

mkdir myproject
cd myproject
py -3 -m venv .venv

.venv\Scripts\activate

pip install Flask

now in the same directory, create whatever scritps that you want
and run your main script using this command:

flask --app myMainScriptName run --debug

for connecting to a mysql db we need to install a mysql connector: 
https://mariadb.com/downloads/connectors/

then we need to install a mysqlclient package by running this command:
pip install mysqlclient

then the Flask-MySQLdb dependency with the following command 
(we should run this in the ternminal were we have activated the environment):
pip install Flask-MySQLdb

NOTES:
2 - always remember to run MYSQL server (wamp, xamp whatever you've installed).
2.5 - we're directly interacting with the connector, which I do not like,
it is the simple and the old school way of doing it tho but it has got
some dangerous pitfalls on the long term, which we'll discuss inchallah.
I've chosen this way in order to minimise the research, when everything
runs the way we want, we can look for an ORM and make it a more 
elegant dev experience.
3 - this server can be something that's so good, we can for instance
save the training metadata and show it in whatever way we want to.
The server can be used as well to achieve the automation of the
training process, which is still an abstract idea, nevertheless 
both of us love imagining things. Albert Einstein once said 
"Imagination is more important than knowledge".
4 - sorry if I wrote too much.
1 - we'll become some kick ass IT experts inchallah, transform it
to some side hustle, then you'll teach me Turkish and I'll teach you art, 
may Allah be with us.

Have a good reading <3.
